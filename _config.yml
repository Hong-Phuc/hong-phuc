  I am a passionate web developer with a strong foundation in **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and Python**.  
  My primary focus is on **building dynamic and responsive web applications**, and I am currently expanding my expertise in **React.js** and **Android development**.  

  While I have experience working with databases like **MongoDB and MySQL**, I primarily focus on integrating them into web applications rather than deep database optimization.  

  I am always eager to learn new technologies and enhance my skills in both **frontend and backend development**.  
  Looking forward to contributing and growing in a professional IT environment.

      Apart from coding, I enjoy **learning and experimenting with new web technologies**.  
      I often spend time **watching tech-related videos, reading blogs**, and trying out new frameworks like **React.js** and **Android development**.  

      I am also interested in **improving code quality and optimizing performance**, always looking for ways to write cleaner and more efficient code.  
      Besides technology, I enjoy **listening to music, watching movies**, and sometimes playing sports to stay active. ðŸš€
